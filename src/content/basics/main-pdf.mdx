Hey, I'm Jack! My unique path, from homelessness to graduating top of my class in Data Science at Cal, taught me to apply data with purpose. I focus on building effective data systems and machine learning models that deliver real impact, like boosting efficiency or predicting key trends. Right now, I'm using these skills for educational equity at Caliber Public Schools and always diving into the latest in AI, especially LLMs.
